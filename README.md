Friday Pizza Calculator

This is an iOS app made to help users calculate the cost of splitting a pizza with your work buddies. You can easily figure out how much each person should chip in based on the amount of slices they've had.

Developed using SwiftUI and Core Data, this app provides a quick way for pizza lovers to figure out how many pizzas you need to order to feed your team and how much each person owes you if you were the one to order the pizza. Core Data saves everything on your phone and gets backed up to iCloud to make sure you don't lose anything.

Through this project, I gained my very first experience in designing and building iOS apps using SwiftUI, as well as working with Core Data to store and manage data. This app proved to be handy as it is still in regular use by some friends and myself.
